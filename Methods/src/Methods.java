        // What are methods in java?
        // They are collections of java statements that are designed to perform an operation
        // Block of code that performs a specific task when called
        // Example of methods:
        // Method to find the largest of three numbers
        // Method to add two numbers

        // Java has predefined methods eg:
        // println(), main()etc
        // By calling println() and passing a string you tell java to print that information on the screen

        // Java has these methods somewhere, where it takes care of the steps required to print information on the screen.

        // Programmers using these methods don't have to worry about the underlying operations

        // Syntax for creating a method in java

        // modifier return-type_method-name (parameters) {
        // Statements;
        // }

        // Keywords used
        // Modifier-> sets the access level for this method and defines from where this method can be accessed

        // Return type - defines the return data type of this method
        // Java offers a return keyword to return a value from within the method

        // name - the name of the method which it can be identified with
        // Parameter list-> list of parameters which the method accepts

        // Calling a method
        // To call a method in java, type the name of the method followed by parenthesis
        // method-name(<parameters>)

        // Benefits of using methods
        // 1. Code re-usability- Promotes code re-usability. Since the method can be defined once and used at multiple places, reducing the redundancy of the code
        // 2. Code readability- Methods make code more readable and easy to understand
        // Code manageability-

        // Return a value from a method
        // You can return a value from a method after an operation
        // Few things to keep in mind about return statements
        // 1. One method can have multiple return statements
        // 2. If the method declaration has a return type other than void, the method should have a return statement. Else the compiler will throw an error
